// spewing cubes idea

point:
	moveToMiddle
		transform:
			x += math.cos(music)*cubeWidth*music    /x //so it moves less the more out it is
			y += math.sin(music)*cubeWidth*music	/y
			z += math.cos?(music)*cubeWidth*music	/z
			x,y,z if > 0 -= someNumber else += someNumber // always goes towards middle, if not pushed more out by music
	
	point-Spawns:
		cubes/spheres at rate*music (with spheres they could set sphere resolution with settings)
			- that falls towards ground.. or could go anywhere, maybe gravity settings is a user setting
		
		cubes/spheres despawn after X seconds (chosen by setting)
			or the oldest cube/sphere despawn when total cubes/spheres count is higher than user.setting (max cubes/spheres)
